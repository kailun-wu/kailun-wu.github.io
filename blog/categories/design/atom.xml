    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These are the UI design that I&rsquo;ve done while playing with <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch 3</a> - fantastic design app by the way.

-> The Weight app wants to be your fastest way to log weight as an alternative to the comprehensive health apps. The idea workflow is glancing at your history in the Notification Center widget or recording new weight in the app within seconds. Since the difference between your weight on each day are usually small, less than 3 seconds should be taken to adjust your last day&rsquo;s weight to your new one. Data is stored to your iCloud account (HeathKit) and can be seen in the Health app, which can also log weight but in a much clunky way. &lt;-</p>
