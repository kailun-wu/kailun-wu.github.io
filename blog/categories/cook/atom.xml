    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I dropped 8 kg to 64 kg this summer by Atkins diet and occasional running. The basic idea is quit eating starch to force myself into consuming body fat. I saw this worked on my college roommate two years ago and decided to take some effort to control my own body this time. The key is no starch diet, a body scale and 2-mile running.</p>

<p>Is it painful? Yes, I was literally starving like never before! It&rsquo;s only after one week did I become used to that state and cannot feel too hungry. But at some point I&rsquo;m feeling like a vegetarian, clean and not demanding. Eating less also made me appreciate the food more and save time on cooking.</p>

<p>You can find recipes and debates on Atkins diet online so I&rsquo;m not going to replicate anything here. What&rsquo;s worth saying are the nicest foods I discovered that keep you full while having low calories.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Papaya: what a gift! Cut it into two half, clean the seeds and eat it with a spoon. Unbelievably easy and satisfying.</p></li>
<li><p>Strawberries: one box is enough for dinner, too acid sometimes, easy to get bored.</p></li>
<li><p>Steamed pumpkin: has relatively high GI value but satisfying nonetheless.</p></li>
<li><p>Miso soup: fast and delicious enough with low calories. Peeled tomatoes, miso paste, sesame oil, diced tofu. Optional: shredded Napa cabbage, diced low-calorie ham, seaweed, shrimp. Topped with minced scallion after boiling.</p></li>
<li><p>Shredded pork with green pepper:  one of <a href="http://www.xiachufang.com/cook/100963158/cooked/">my best practiced recipes</a>. Similar stir-fries: Cauliflower with shrimp, Eggplant with minced meat.</p></li>
<li><p>Salad with low-calorie dressing: without corns and bread of course. Cold, acid and harsh, you don&rsquo;t want it too often.</p></li>
</ul>
