    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I dropped 8 kg to 64 kg this summer by Atkins diet and occasional running. The basic idea is quit eating starch to force myself into consuming body fat. I saw this worked on my college roommate two years ago and decided to take some effort to control my own body this time. The key is avoid eating starchy and a body scale.</p>

<p>Is it painful? Yes, I was literally starving like never before! It&rsquo;s only after one week did I become used to that state and cannot feel too hungry. At some point I even felt clean and not demanding. Eating less also made me appreciate the food more and save time on cooking.</p>

<p>You can find recipes and debates on Atkins diet online so I&rsquo;m not going to replicate anything here. What&rsquo;s worth saying are the nicest foods I discovered that keep you full while having low calories.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Papaya: what a gift! Cut it into two half, clean the seeds and eat it with a spoon. Unbelievably easy and satisfying.</p></li>
<li><p>Strawberries: one box is enough for dinner, too acid sometimes, easy to get bored.</p></li>
<li><p>Steamed pumpkin: has relatively high GI value but satisfying nonetheless.</p></li>
<li><p>Miso soup: fast and delicious enough with low calories. Peeled tomatoes, miso paste, sesame oil, diced tofu. Optional: shredded Napa cabbage, diced low-calorie ham, seaweed, shrimp. Topped with minced scallion after boiling.</p></li>
<li><p>Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino w/ cream and w/o sugar: Fantastic! Diet drinks doesn&rsquo;t have to suck.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Plus, any stir-fries are edible as long as no sugar is added. Shredded pork with green pepper is one of <a href="http://www.xiachufang.com/cook/100963158/cooked/">my best practiced Sichuan recipes</a>. Salad with low-calorie dressing and without corns or bread was my choice of meal. But it&rsquo;s cold, acid and harsh so you don&rsquo;t want it too often.</p>
