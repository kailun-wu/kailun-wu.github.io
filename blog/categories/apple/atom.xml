    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Watching <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=203">a WWDC session video</a> on HealthKit, I&rsquo;m more than sure that leading technology companies won&rsquo;t be born in China or elsewhere, unless they&rsquo;ve mastered how to design great OS, library, and even hardware-software integration.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s because ultimately, users are using services in apps on OSes. Without the support from the OS and APIs, nowhere can innovation of apps, services and peripherals be rooted. Apple is wielding so much power because, for example, how health data is saved and used on the iPhone is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#healthkit">defined</a> by Apple, rather than by Jawbone or data miners.</p>

<p>Right now, major OSes are owned by American companies and the key people involved are in American. All other attempts like BB 10, WebOS and MeeGo are largely failed. Room for a new OS is small, because its prosperity depends on the synergy of itself, developers, users and hardware. Besides, coming late will make things more difficult, as in the case of BB 10 and Windows Phone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible that content, internet services and cloud will outweight OSes and devices. Maybe OS will be what we take for granted and radical innovation doesn&rsquo;t require much from the underlying layer.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Maybe the value and money will move towards being OS-agnostic, as is seen in Google, Facebook, and online advertisement. That&rsquo;s why the importance of Amazon phone is not so great. But the outcome is unclear because our world of devices and services is not a zero-sum game, at least for now.</p>

<p>So much for the mumble. Showing opinions on the internet is cheap. I should resume the video now. :S</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much layers of abstraction we&rsquo;ve made: from transistors to bits to softwares to ecosystems. Kevin Kelly&rsquo;s description on life and evolution is manifested in the world of bits again: autonomous entities form groups, abstraction emerges from groups, abstractions on top of abstractions.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://kailun-wu.github.io/blog/sept-2013-apple-keynote-take-on/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sad to know the absence of new 4-inch models. Where&rsquo;re the 4-inch iPhones for the rest of us? The stasis on screen size during the 4-inch era and the sudden transition to 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch are not the optimal roadmap, unless Apple are quite confident about the mainstream adoption of 4.7-inch this time. Anyway, people who love 4-inch should be able to get a top-notch iPhone every year, right?</p>

<p>On the watch: fundamentally, why do I have to bear with the complexity of managing yet another device? <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/apple-watch-asking-saying/">The lack of explaining</a> on why it needs to exist made the keynote less compelling.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Tim Cook never talk about the incentives and human factors as much <a href="http://longform.org/stories/playboy-interview-steve-jobs">as Steve did</a> because liberal arts seem not so innate to Tim.</p>

<p>Apple is more capable of developing system and applications now. This is more evident on the new watch. The original iPhone and iPad came with limited features, and the delay of OS X Leopard was caused by developing that very iPhone. But the apps and services on the watch are abundant on day one. Only the hardware definitely needs more iterations. I can&rsquo;t wait for <a href="http://www.hi-id.com/?p=2639">the iPhone-4-equivalent</a> of it because I&rsquo;m even more extreme than Braun on minimal and angular chassis.</p>

<p>Seriously, Jony Ive should leave icons alone! Icons in iOS 8 are still overly saturated and arbitrary to me. The only applicable wallpapers to me on iOS are limited to dark ones because of the vibrancy of app icons. We&rsquo;ve seen Apple design went extreme and weird before returning to rational. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll happen to iOS icons as well, quickly.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-017-lets-end-it-there-updated/">the 17th episode</a> of Exponent, Ben Thompson said that the lack of reasoning and the massive amount of features may indicate a lack of clear sense on the watch within Apple. To consumers, too much features dilute the <em>essential</em> functions that makes the new category compelling.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
