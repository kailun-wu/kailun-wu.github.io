I dropped 8 kg this summer (64 kg now) by [Atkins diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_diet) and running. The basic idea is quit eating starch to force myself into consuming body fat while using a scale to keep me motivated. I saw this worked on a college roommate two years ago and decided to take some effort to control my own body this time.

Is it painful? Yes, I was literally starving like never before! It's only after one week did I become used to that state and cannot feel too hungry. At some point I even felt clean, comfortable and not demanding. Eating less also made me appreciate the food more and save time on cooking.

You can find recipes and debates on Atkins diet online so I'm not going to replicate anything. What's worth saying are the nicest foods I discovered that keep you full while having low calories and low GI[^1].

- Papaya: what a gift! Cut it into two half, clean the seeds and eat it with a spoon. Unbelievably easy and satisfying.

- Strawberries: one box is enough for dinner, too acid sometimes, easy to get bored. Same goes for kiwifood.

- Steamed pumpkin: has relatively high GI but satisfying nonetheless.

- Miso soup: fast and delicious enough. Boil: peeled tomatoes, miso paste, sesame oil, diced tofu. Optional: shredded Napa cabbage, diced low-calorie ham, seaweed, shrimp. Topped with minced scallion after boiling.

- Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino w/ cream and w/o sugar: Fantastic! Diet drinks doesn't have to suck.

- Any stir-fries are edible as long as no sugar is added. Shredded pork with green pepper is one of [my best practiced Sichuan recipes](http://www.xiachufang.com/cook/100963158/cooked/). 

- Salad with low-calorie dressing and without corns or bread was my choice of meal. But it's cold, acid and harsh so you don't want it too often.
