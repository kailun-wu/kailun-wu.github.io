Watching [a WWDC session video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=203) on HealthKit, I'm more than sure that leading technology companies won't be born in China or India, unless they've mastered how to design great OS, frameworks, and even hardware-software integration.[^1] It's because in the end, users are using services in apps on OSes. Without the support from the OS and APIs, nowhere can innovation of apps, services and peripherals take roots. Apple is wielding so much power because they own most of the stuff they need. For example, how health data is saved and used on the iPhone is [defined in HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#healthkit) by Apple, rather than by Jawbone or data miners.

Right now, major OSes are owned by American companies and the key people involved are in America. All other attempts like BB 10, WebOS and MeeGo are largely failed. Building another OS is hard, because it depends on too much: timing, OS, developers, users and hardware.

Though hardware have been evolving much faster than software, it's possible that content, internet services and cloud will outweigh OS and devices. Maybe OS will be what we take for granted and radical innovation doesn't require much from the underlying layer.[^2] Maybe the value and money will move towards being OS-agnostic, as is seen in Google, Facebook, and online advertisement. And that's why Amazon phone is not a necessity for Amazon itself. For now our world of devices and services is not a zero-sum game, but future awaits to be seen.

So much for the mumble. Showing opinions on the internet is cheap. I should resume the video now. :S

[update] The good news is Android already provide a good enought OS for anyone to customize. Among the hardware manufactures that are trying hard to differentiate their flavour of Android, Xiaomi is closest to Apple: after years of iterations and community feedback MIUI is highly polished and loaded with local services; Xiaomi produces peripherals that works with MIUI, including TV, routers and even air purifiers, which Apple would hesitate or never make.

[^1]: The city of Shenzhen becomes more and more interesting as a hardware heaven. See [Hacking Shenzhen](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593590-why-southern-china-best-place-world-hardware-innovator-be-hacking) from The Economist.

[^2]: It's amazing how much layers of abstraction we've made: from transistors to bits to softwares to ecosystems. Kevin Kelly's description on life and evolution is manifested in the world of bits again: autonomous entities form groups, abstraction emerges from groups, abstractions on top of abstractions.
