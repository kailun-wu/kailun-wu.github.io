Programming languages are really close to linguistics, for what we made and use will reshape us. It's been believed that German the language contributes to the abundance of philosophers in Germany. [^1] Steve Jobs, [back in the 1995](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/steve-jobs-the-lost-interview/id536749587):

> We use them (programming) in the work, but much more importantly, it does nothing to do with using them for anything practical. Have to do with using them to be a mirror of your thought process, to actually learn how to think. 

> I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think. It's like going to law school. I don't think everybody should be a lawyer, but I think going to law school may actually be useful coz it teaches you how to think in a certain way. In the same way the computer programming teaches you in a slightly different way how to think. So I view computer science as a liberal arts. It should be something everybody takes in a year in their life, one of the courses they take is learning how to program.

Interesting to see how this correlates with ["Human needs not apply"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU).
